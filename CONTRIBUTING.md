Contributing to Webmock
=======================

Contributions are more than welcome.
Please make your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request.
Pull requests should pass all existing tests and should add test and documentation for any new code.

Keep in mind that this is intended to be a very simple utility for testing.
Don't make simple things complicated, and don't implement complicated things in this tool!

If you don't hear a response from me within a week, please post to the issue or pull request again, or contact me through email (dustin@cs.uchicago.edu).
